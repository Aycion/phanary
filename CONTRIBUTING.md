# How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

> ### The Phanary Philosophy
>
> Phanary was designed and built to be a **powerful**, **fast**, and **free** option for RPG game masters to use to provide atmospheric music and sound effects.
>
> Its primary utility lies in its effectiveness at searching and playing relevant sounds as quickly as possible.
>
> The success of this project can be measured by how well it can be used unobtrusively in a game session to maintain pacing, flow, and immersion.

Phanary has an [extensive to-do list](https://github.com/bencodrington/phanary/projects) of features to add and enhancements to make, many of which have been born directly from user suggestions and ideas.
[Open an issue](https://github.com/bencodrington/phanary/issues/new) that describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code Style

* **CamelCase** should be used for class and variable names.
* JavaScript class names should start with a **Capital**.
* CSS classes should be named using [The **BEM** Approach](http://getbem.com/naming/).
